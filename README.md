If you have need of any of the unimplemented functionality [bug me by filing

you.


#### Troubleshooting

Compiling on Windows (particularly MSVC) takes a bit of effort. Better
documentation is needed (please contribute!). If you have trouble please file
an [issue](https://github.com/cogciprocate/ocl/issues) and let us know about
the problem so we can improve our documentation.

Your device drivers should include OpenCL drivers. If not, download the
appropriate SDK from one of the following links:
[AMD](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/),
[NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl),
[Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-opencl)
